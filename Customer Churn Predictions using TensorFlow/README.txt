1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The code reads a CSV file ('Churn.csv'), performs one-hot encoding on categorical features, and separates the dataset into input features (`x`) and target variable (`y`) indicating churn.

2. **Model Building:**
   - It creates a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API with one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer with binary classification activation. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer.

3. **Model Training:**
   - The model is trained on the training data (`X_train_tensor`, `y_train_tensor`) for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The trained model is used to predict on the test data (`X_test_tensor`), and predictions are converted to binary values. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using `accuracy_score` from scikit-learn.

5. **Model Saving and Reloading:**
   - The trained model is saved to disk as 'tfmodel'. It is then deleted from memory and later reloaded using `load_model` from TensorFlow's Keras API.
